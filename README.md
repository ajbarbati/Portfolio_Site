# Portfolio_Site

# - Outline

    - Index
        
        - Tools and Technologies

            - back-end tech will need to be researched more but for now I think I will just be using github to host

            - I can look into other options later 
        
        - Layout

            - Open on to a graphic image that I design and make with a paragraph about me 

            - scrolling leads you to the next page which is my projects 1 by 1 for the 3 best

            - 4th page is links to the rest of my projects and each link will be a gif of each website/project

            - possible 5th page could be a more long form about me with career goals ideals or w/e

            - all the while a footer or header will display all contact info and maybe small picture/icon img of me
        
        - Under the Hood

            - the graphic image should be my line art from the Ipad or use that as a texrured background

            - the scrolling will be tinder card like swiping I want my portfolio to be unique and show talent

            - getting gifs of each website will probably require screen capping and using a gif maker

            -also maybe think about using javascript to dynamically load content to page.
